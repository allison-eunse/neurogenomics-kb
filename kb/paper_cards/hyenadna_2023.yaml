summary: |
  HyenaDNA adapts Hyena implicit-convolution operators to genomic sequences, achieving up to 1M
  token context at single-nucleotide resolution while remaining computationally feasible.
  Pretrained as a decoder-only next-token model on the human reference genome with a sequence-length
  warm-up schedule, HyenaDNA attains state-of-the-art performance on Nucleotide Transformer and
  GenomicBenchmarks tasks using orders of magnitude fewer parameters and pretraining data than
  prior DNA foundation models.^[See arXiv:2306.15794](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15794)

key_contributions:
  - "Demonstrates 1M-token context genomic modeling with character-level tokens using Hyena operators."
  - "Introduces sequence-length warm-up to stabilize and speed up ultralong-context training."
  - "Shows strong downstream performance with ~1.6M parameters and a single human genome of pretraining data."
  - "Provides soft-prompt adaptation recipes for downstream tasks without full fine-tuning."

architecture:
  backbone: "Decoder-only Hyena blocks (implicit long convolutions with data-controlled gating)"
  context_length: "1,000,000 tokens"
  tokenization: "Character-level (A/C/G/T/N + specials)"
  params: "≈1.6M (reported in the NeurIPS paper)"

implications_for_project:
  - "Establishes Hyena-style operators as a viable alternative to attention for ultra-long genomic contexts."
  - "Provides a discriminative complement to Evo 2’s generative StripedHyena-2 models in the KB."
  - "Suggests sequence-length warm-up and soft prompting as design patterns for future neuro-omics FMs (e.g., long-range EEG or fMRI)."
