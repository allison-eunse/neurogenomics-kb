summary: |
  Late integration via heterogeneous ensembles (LR/trees/SVM) outperforms early fusion 
  for multimodal biological data (STRING protein networks, EHR COVID-19 mortality). 
  Introduces rank-based interpretation method for ensemble importance.

key_takeaways:
  - "Late fusion preserves modality-specific signal under heterogeneous semantics"
  - "Stacking with diverse base learners (LR, RF, SVM) improves robustness and handles missing data"
  - "Rank-based interpretation aggregates feature importance across heterogeneous models"
  - "Outperforms early fusion (graph-based, concatenation) on STRING and EHR tasks"

methods:
  integration_strategy: "late_fusion"
  base_learners: ["logistic_regression", "random_forest", "svm"]
  meta_learner: "stacking_with_cross_validation"
  interpretation: "rank_aggregation_of_feature_importance"
  
datasets_used:
  - "STRING protein-protein interaction networks (multi-view)"
  - "EHR (electronic health records) for COVID-19 mortality prediction"

implications_for_project:
  - "Adopt LR + GBDT (LightGBM/CatBoost) as per-modality and fusion baselines"
  - "Consider EI-style stacking after simple late-fusion baselines succeed"
  - "Use permutation importance + rank aggregation for interpretability"
  - "Justifies late integration first for gene-brain heterogeneous semantics"
