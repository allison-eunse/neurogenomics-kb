summary: |
  Systematic review of multimodal integration strategies in oncology. 
  Codifies taxonomy (early/intermediate/late fusion), cautions on heterogeneous semantics,
  alignment, missingness, modality collapse, over-smoothing (GNNs), confounds, and leakage.

key_takeaways:
  - "Taxonomy: early fusion (feature concat), intermediate (shared latent), late fusion (decision-level)"
  - "Heterogeneous semantics → prefer late integration to preserve modality-specific signal"
  - "Critical confounds: site/scanner, acquisition parameters, batch effects, demographics"
  - "Evaluation discipline: stratified CV, same folds across modalities, AUROC/AUPRC, calibration, significance tests"
  - "Failure modes: alignment errors, missing data, over-smoothing in GNNs, leakage from preprocessing"

methods:
  integration_levels:
    early: "Feature concatenation or joint graph construction before training"
    intermediate: "Shared encoder or joint latent space (e.g., VAE, contrastive)"
    late: "Train per-modality models, ensemble predictions"
  recommended_practices:
    - "Residualization/harmonization of features vs covariates"
    - "Fold sharing across modalities for fair comparison"
    - "Report AUROC, AUPRC with CIs; use DeLong/bootstrap for significance"
    - "Control for site, demographics, motion (imaging), batch (omics)"

implications_for_project:
  - "Start with late integration (gene vs brain vs fusion) for heterogeneous modalities"
  - "Z-score + residualize features against age/sex/site/motion/genetic PCs"
  - "Use same CV folds; report AUC/AUPRC ± SD; test fusion gains with DeLong"
  - "Defer early/intermediate fusion until baselines establish fusion value"
