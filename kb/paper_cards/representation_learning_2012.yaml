summary: |
  Foundational survey of representation learning and deep learning that formalizes why learned
  representations—especially distributed, hierarchical ones—are critical for generalization,
  transfer, and sample efficiency across modalities. Reviews probabilistic models, autoencoders,
  manifold learning, and deep architectures, and articulates design principles (distributed
  codes, depth, sparsity, temporal/spatial coherence) that underpin modern foundation models.^[See arXiv:1206.5538](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5538)

key_contributions:
  - "Clarifies the role of distributed, sparse, and hierarchical representations in overcoming the curse of dimensionality."
  - "Connects autoencoders, RBMs/DBNs, manifold learning, and deep neural networks under a unified representation-learning lens."
  - "Defines desiderata for good representations (disentangling factors of variation, invariance/equivariance, smoothness)."
  - "Highlights unsupervised and self-supervised pretraining as key to transfer and semi-supervised learning."

implications_for_project:
  - "Provides the conceptual backbone for why neuro-omics foundation models should prioritize shared latent spaces across genes, brain, and behaviour."
  - "Motivates the KB’s emphasis on disentangled, hierarchical embeddings and late fusion before escalating to unified generative models."
  - "Frames evaluation beyond task accuracy—e.g., probing for factor disentanglement, invariances (RC, anatomical), and transfer."
