summary: |
  Introduces Reverse-Complement Consistency Regularization (RCCR), a model-agnostic fine-tuning
  objective that penalizes disagreement between a DNA language model’s predictions on a sequence
  and its reverse complement. RCCR improves RC robustness (lower flip rates, higher RC correlation)
  across diverse backbones (Nucleotide Transformer v2, DNABERT-2, HyenaDNA) while maintaining or
  improving task performance on classification and regression tasks.^[See arXiv:2509.18529](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18529)

key_contributions:
  - "Defines RCCR, a simple consistency term between predictions on x and RC(x) with task-aware alignment."
  - "Provides theoretical guarantees that symmetrization is risk non-increasing and global minimizers are RC-consistent under symmetric labels."
  - "Demonstrates backbone-agnostic gains in RC robustness across multiple DNA LMs and task types."
  - "Introduces standardized RC metrics (sequence flip rate, RC-Corr) for evaluating DNA LMs."

implications_for_project:
  - "Supplies a drop-in recipe to retrofit RC robustness onto non-equivariant backbones in the KB (e.g., Evo 2, HyenaDNA)."
  - "Motivates tracking RC-specific metrics alongside AUROC/AUPRC in genetics experiments."
  - "Suggests consistency-regularization patterns that can generalize to other biological symmetries (e.g., anatomical flips in imaging)."

notes: "RCCR is intended for RC-symmetric/equivariant tasks only; strand-specific tasks require disabling or modifying the regularizer."
