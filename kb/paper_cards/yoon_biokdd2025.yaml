summary: |
  Application of Caduceus and DNABERT-2 to MDD classification using 38 candidate genes.
  Demonstrates LOGO (Leave-One-Gene-Out) attribution with nested CV, Wilcoxon tests,
  and FDR control. Identifies SOD2 as top predictive gene.

key_contributions:
  - "MDD classification from gene embeddings: AUC ~0.85"
  - "LOGO attribution protocol: ΔAUC per gene with statistical rigor"
  - "Nested CV + Wilcoxon signed-rank + FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg)"
  - "SOD2 emerges as most important gene (consistent with oxidative stress literature)"

methods:
  models_used: ["Caduceus", "DNABERT-2"]
  gene_set: "38 MDD candidate genes from literature"
  embeddings: "Exon-level pooling → gene-level aggregation"
  attribution: "LOGO with nested CV; ΔAUC; Wilcoxon + FDR"
  evaluation: "AUROC, AUPRC; balanced class weights"

key_takeaways_for_us:
  - "RC-averaging critical for stable embeddings (Caduceus)"
  - "LOGO is gold standard for interpretable gene importance"
  - "Nested CV avoids optimistic bias in attribution"
  - "Mean pooling over exons works well for gene-level features"

implications_for_project:
  - "Direct methodological template for our genetics pipeline"
  - "Adopt LOGO protocol exactly as described"
  - "Use same gene set (38 MDD genes) for initial baselines"
  - "Expected to replicate SOD2 signal as sanity check"

notes: "Our own prior work; exact protocol to follow for genetics-only baseline"
