summary: |
  Long-context generative DNA language model. Transformer decoder with 6-mer tokenization.
  Shows strong performance on genomic benchmarks and generation tasks.

key_contributions:
  - "Generative DNA LM: autoregressive modeling of genomic sequences"
  - "6-mer tokenization: balance between char-level and BPE"
  - "Long-context capability for regulatory and structural variants"

architecture:
  backbone: "GPT-style Transformer decoder"
  tokenization: "6-mer with deterministic framing"
  context_length: "Long (exact length TBD from paper)"

key_takeaways_for_us:
  - "6-mer tokenization requires careful RC handling (frame alignment)"
  - "Apply RC at nucleotide level first, then tokenize deterministically"
  - "Mean pooling over tokens for sequence embeddings"
  - "Test RC-averaging stability vs Caduceus"

implications_for_project:
  - "Alternative genetics FM to Caduceus/Evo2"
  - "Ablation: compare GENERator vs Caduceus vs Evo2 embeddings"
  - "Tokenizer hygiene critical: document k-mer frame handling"

notes: "Read for 6-mer/RC details; ensure deterministic tokenization in pipeline"
