summary: |
  Guidelines for GWAS in diverse ancestries. Emphasizes population stratification control,
  admixture modeling, trans-ancestry meta-analysis, and ethical considerations.

key_takeaways:
  - "Population stratification is the primary confound; control with PCs (10-20)"
  - "Diverse cohorts improve power and generalizability but require careful QC"
  - "Trans-ancestry meta-analysis can fine-map causal variants"
  - "Ethical considerations: equitable benefit, community engagement, data sovereignty"

methods:
  ancestry_control:
    - "Compute genetic PCs (recommend 10-20 for diverse samples)"
    - "Use ancestry-specific or admixture-adjusted analyses"
    - "Avoid naive pooling without PC adjustment"
  qc_for_diversity:
    - "Check for batch effects correlated with ancestry"
    - "Use LD-aware clumping within ancestry groups"
    - "Validate in independent ancestries when possible"

implications_for_project:
  - "Always include top 10 genetic PCs as covariates (already in manifest stub)"
  - "Document ancestry composition of UKB sample"
  - "If UK Biobank is primarily European, note generalization limits"
  - "Future: test gene embeddings in diverse cohorts (ADNI, PPMI, others)"

notes: "Reinforces importance of genetic PC control; keep in mind for future diverse cohorts"
