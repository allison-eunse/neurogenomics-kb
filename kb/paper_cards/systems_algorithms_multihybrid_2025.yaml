summary: |
  Presents convolutional multi-hybrid architectures, instantiated as StripedHyena 2, that combine
  multiple input-dependent convolution operators with attention and are co-designed with hardware-
  aware kernels and context-parallel training strategies. At 40B parameters, StripedHyena 2 trains
  faster than optimized Transformers and prior hybrids, and underpins the Evo 2 line of genomic
  foundation models over 1M-token contexts.^[See arXiv:2503.01868](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01868)

key_contributions:
  - "Defines multi-hybrid operator families (Hyena-SE, Hyena-MR, Hyena-LI) specialized for different sequence scales."
  - "Introduces overlap-add blocked kernels and FlashFFTConv-based implementations for high-throughput convolutions."
  - "Develops context parallelism strategies (all-to-all, point-to-point) for million-token training on H100 GPUs."
  - "Demonstrates end-to-end speedups and strong performance on byte-tokenized data, including Evo 2 genomics models."

implications_for_project:
  - "Provides systems recipes for training ultra-long-context genomics FMs like Evo 2 that appear elsewhere in the KB."
  - "Informs future brain-sequence models (e.g., long fMRI/EEG) where sub-quadratic operators and context parallelism are critical."
  - "Reinforces architecture–hardware co-design as a requirement for ARPA-H-scale Brain–Omics Models."

notes: "Treat as a systems/architecture companion to Evo 2 and HyenaDNA; consult the paper for exact kernel/parallelism details before implementation."
