summary: |
  Comprehensive protocol for PRS computation, QC, and association testing.
  Covers clumping, p-value thresholding, ancestry adjustment, and validation.

key_takeaways:
  - "Standard PRS pipeline: QC → clump → threshold → score → validate"
  - "Ancestry control critical: use within-ancestry GWAS + adjust with PCs"
  - "Multiple p-value thresholds (e.g., 5e-8, 1e-5, 0.05, 1.0) for robustness"
  - "Validate PRS in independent cohort; report R² and OR with CIs"

methods:
  qc_steps:
    - "Remove SNPs with MAF < 0.01, genotyping rate < 95%, HWE p < 1e-6"
    - "Remove samples with high missingness, relatedness, non-European ancestry (if GWAS is European)"
  prs_computation:
    - "Clumping: LD r² < 0.1, window 250kb"
    - "P-value thresholds: test multiple (5e-8, 1e-5, 1e-3, 0.05, 0.5, 1.0)"
    - "Weighted sum: PRS = Σ(βᵢ × dosageᵢ)"
  association:
    - "Logistic/linear regression: outcome ~ PRS + age + sex + PCs"
    - "Report Nagelkerke R², OR, β with 95% CIs"

implications_for_project:
  - "Optional extension after FM embeddings: compute PRS for MDD/cognition"
  - "Compare PRS vs FM embeddings: which predicts better?"
  - "Partial correlations: PRS vs brain features vs gene embeddings"
  - "Control genetic PCs in all analyses (overlaps with PRS adjustment)"
