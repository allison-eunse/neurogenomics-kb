summary: |
  JEPA (Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture) for fMRI. Uses functional gradient
  positioning and spatiotemporal masking (Cross-ROI, Cross-Time, Double-Cross) to learn
  semantic latent representations. Better linear-probe performance than MAE baselines.

key_contributions:
  - "JEPA framework adapted for fMRI: predict target latents from context latents"
  - "Brain Gradient Positioning: functional coordinate system (not anatomical)"
  - "Spatiotemporal masking strategies emphasize long-range dependencies"
  - "Superior downstream task performance vs MAE (age, sex, cognition)"

architecture:
  backbone: "Transformer encoder (context) + predictor (targets)"
  positioning: "Brain functional gradients (consistent across subjects/sites)"
  masking:
    - "Cross-ROI: mask entire ROI time series"
    - "Cross-Time: mask contiguous time blocks"
    - "Double-Cross: combined spatial + temporal"
  pooling: "Mean pooling over context encoder tokens"

key_takeaways_for_us:
  - "Better off-the-shelf representations than BrainLM MAE"
  - "Functional positioning reduces site sensitivity"
  - "Extract embeddings via mean pooling; project to 512-D"
  - "Stronger for linear probing → good for late fusion baselines"

implications_for_project:
  - "Alternative to BrainLM for fMRI embeddings (Option B)"
  - "Test both BrainLM and Brain-JEPA; compare linear-probe age/sex AUCs"
  - "Use in late fusion: [gene_512 | brainjepa_512] → LR/GBDT"
  - "Functional positioning may help with multi-site robustness"

notes: "JEPA often outperforms MAE for downstream tasks; worth testing alongside BrainLM"
