summary: |
  Survey of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for medical imaging, with emphasis on radiology.
  Reviews architectures that pair vision encoders with LLMs via multimodal connectors, catalogs existing
  datasets and systems, and discusses clinical applications, limitations (e.g., hallucination, grounding),
  and future research directions.

key_contributions:
  - "Systematic taxonomy of medical MLLM architectures and training strategies for imaging + text."
  - "Comprehensive review of datasets and benchmarks for radiology-focused multimodal models."
  - "Analysis of current capabilities and safety/robustness gaps in clinical deployment."
  - "Roadmap highlighting grounded reasoning, data curation, and evaluation as key open problems."

implications_for_project:
  - "Provides context for positioning neuro-omics multimodal FMs relative to broader medical MLLMs."
  - "Informs design of brain-image + text report generation pipelines and evaluation protocols."
  - "Highlights common failure modes (hallucination, poor grounding) to monitor when adapting VLMs to neuro-omics."
