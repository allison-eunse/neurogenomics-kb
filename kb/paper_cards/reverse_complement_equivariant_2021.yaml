summary: |
  This paper characterizes the full space of reverse-complement (RC) equivariant convolutional
  layers for DNA sequences using group representation theory, going beyond earlier RC parameter
  sharing (RCPS) designs. It introduces irrep-based feature spaces, RC-equivariant nonlinearities,
  k-mer embeddings, and batch normalization, and shows that new architectures can surpass RCPS on
  transcription factor binding tasks, especially in low-data regimes.

key_contributions:
  - "Complete characterization of translation- and RC-equivariant linear layers for 1D DNA sequences."
  - "Irreducible-representation (irrep) feature spaces with +1/−1 channels and compatible nonlinearities."
  - "RC-equivariant k-mer embeddings and batch normalization schemes."
  - "Empirical demonstration that exploring the broader equivariant design space improves TF binding prediction."

implications_for_project:
  - "Provides the theoretical underpinning for RC-equivariant DNA FMs like Caduceus in the KB."
  - "Motivates encoding biological symmetries (RC, anatomical flips) architecturally rather than relying only on augmentation."
  - "Informs future RC-aware embedding recipes and attribution methods for genetics modules."
