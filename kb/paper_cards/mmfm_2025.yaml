summary: |
  Broad survey of medical multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) that integrate images, text, and
  other clinical data for diagnosis and treatment. Organizes MMFMs into vision-only and
  vision–language families, catalogs datasets and proxy tasks, and analyzes opportunities and
  challenges for clinical deployment.

key_contributions:
  - "Taxonomy of medical multimodal vision and vision–language foundation models."
  - "Survey of datasets, proxy tasks, and downstream applications across diagnosis, treatment, and robotics."
  - "Discussion of data quality, compute, fairness, interpretability, and regulatory challenges."
  - "Identification of future research directions for generalized medical AI."

implications_for_project:
  - "Contextualizes neuro-omics multimodal model design within the broader MMFM landscape."
  - "Highlights clinical use-cases and risks relevant when extending gene–brain models to diagnosis and treatment support."
  - "Provides vocabulary and taxonomy for documenting multimodal architectures in the KB."
