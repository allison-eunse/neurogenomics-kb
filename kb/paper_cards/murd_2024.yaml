summary: |
  Proposes MURD, a multi-site unsupervised representation disentangler for MRI harmonisation that
  disentangles site-invariant anatomical content and site-specific appearance style. Trains a single
  deep generative model across many sites without requiring traveling human phantoms, enabling
  retrospective harmonisation of T1/T2 images for downstream analysis.

key_contributions:
  - "Unified multi-site harmonisation model that scales beyond pairwise GAN mappings."
  - "Content/style disentanglement to preserve anatomy while adjusting site appearance."
  - "Demonstrates improved inter-site consistency and downstream performance on >6,000 T1/T2 scans."

implications_for_project:
  - "Candidate deep harmonisation method for T1/T2 volumes feeding FreeSurfer IDPs or brain FMs."
  - "Provides an image-space alternative to ComBat when site effects are large or non-linear."
  - "Motivates an explicit harmonisation ID (`murd_t1_t2`) in integration cards for ablation studies."

notes: "Treat as an optional deep harmonisation module; ensure robustness checks so that anatomical signal is preserved."
