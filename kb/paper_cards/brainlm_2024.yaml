summary: |
  ViT-MAE for fMRI: masked autoencoding on parcel time series. Pretrained on UK Biobank
  + HCP (thousands of subjects, multi-site). Shows strong linear-probe performance on
  downstream tasks (age/sex/anxiety) and generalization to external cohorts.

key_contributions:
  - "Self-supervised MAE pretraining on large-scale fMRI (UKB + HCP)"
  - "Nystromformer encoder for efficient attention over parcels × time patches"
  - "Site-invariant representations via diverse multi-site pretraining"
  - "Strong zero-shot network inference and forecasting capabilities"

architecture:
  backbone: "ViT-MAE with Nystromformer encoder + lightweight decoder"
  params: "111M / 650M checkpoints"
  inputs: "424 parcels × 490 timepoints → windowed patches"
  masking_ratio: "~75% of patches masked during pretraining"
  pooling: "Mean pooling over encoder tokens → subject-level embedding"

key_takeaways_for_us:
  - "Extract subject embeddings via [CLS] or mean pooling after encoding"
  - "Project to 512-D for downstream tasks (PCA or small MLP)"
  - "Robust to site differences; validates on UKB + external HCP"
  - "Linear probes achieve strong age/sex/cognition prediction"

implications_for_project:
  - "Primary fMRI FM candidate (Option B in modality features)"
  - "Use pretrained checkpoints for subject-level rs-fMRI embeddings"
  - "Late fusion with gene embeddings: [gene_512 | brain_512] → LR/GBDT"
  - "Sanity check: predict age/sex with linear probe before fusion experiments"
