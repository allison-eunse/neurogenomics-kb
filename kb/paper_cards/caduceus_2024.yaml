summary: |
  RC-equivariant DNA foundation model using BiMamba/Hyena. Enforces reverse-complement
  symmetry via architectural constraints (RC Positional Symmetry). Shows gains on
  genomic benchmarks and MDD classification via learned strand-robust representations.

key_contributions:
  - "RC-equivariant architecture: forward and RC embeddings are predictable transforms"
  - "BiMamba + Hyena: efficient long-range modeling (up to 1M context)"
  - "RC Positional Symmetry (RCPS): specialized positional encoding preserving strand symmetry"
  - "Strong performance on genomic benchmarks (Nucleotide Transformer tasks, GUE)"

architecture:
  backbone: "BiMamba (bidirectional Mamba) or Hyena"
  context_length: "up to 1M tokens"
  rc_mechanism: "RCPS positional encoding + equivariant layer design"
  tokenization: "character-level (A/C/G/T/N)"

key_takeaways_for_us:
  - "Always RC-average embeddings: z = (forward + RC) / 2"
  - "Use mean pooling over tokens (more stable than CLS for DNA)"
  - "Strand-robust gene vectors suitable for cross-modal fusion"
  - "Demonstrated on MDD classification (see Yoon et al. BIOKDD '25 for details)"

implications_for_project:
  - "Primary genetics FM candidate for gene embeddings"
  - "RC-averaging protocol is critical hygiene step"
  - "Exon-level pooling → gene → subject aggregation"
  - "LOGO attribution (ΔAUC) to identify key genes (e.g., SOD2)"
