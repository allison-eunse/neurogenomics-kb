id: hyenadna
name: HyenaDNA
modality: genetics
domain: dna
summary: |
  Genomic foundation model that uses Hyena implicit-convolution operators to model DNA sequences at
  single-nucleotide resolution with context lengths up to 1M tokens. Pretrained as a decoder-only
  language model on the human reference genome, HyenaDNA achieves strong performance on regulatory
  element benchmarks while using far fewer parameters and less data than attention-based DNA LMs.
arch:
  type: "Decoder-only Hyena operator stack (implicit long convolutions)"
  backbone: "Hyena-style 1D sequence model adapted for genomics (see hyenadna_2023 paper)"
  parameters: "≈1.6M (reported baseline configuration)"
  context_length: 1000000
  special_features:
    - "Sub-quadratic Hyena operators enabling 1M-token context at single-nucleotide resolution."
    - "Sequence-length warm-up schedule for stable ultralong-context training."
    - "Soft-prompt adaptation for downstream tasks without full fine-tuning."

    # - Load pretrained HyenaDNA checkpoint.
    # - Run autoregressive forward pass to obtain logits or hidden states.

notes: |
  This card records HyenaDNA as a conceptual and architectural reference for long-context genomics.
  The KB currently uses Evo 2 as the primary StripedHyena-2 implementation with 1M context; HyenaDNA
  provides complementary evidence that Hyena operators work well for discriminative DNA tasks and
  motivates future long-context genetics embeddings.
