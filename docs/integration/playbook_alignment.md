# Alignment playbook

## Objectives
- CLIP-style contrastive alignment between gene and brain embeddings (InfoNCE)
- Deep CCA variant for downstream linear alignment
- Site-robustness via gradient reversal layers

## Evaluation plan
- Linear probe over frozen aligned representations
- Fine-tune end-to-end for key targets after probe sanity checks
