# KB Cards

We maintain lightweight, reusable “cards” to capture:

- Integration principles (cross-domain guidance we adopt)
- Method families (e.g., Ensemble Integration)
- External model patterns (two-tower, JEPA/hub-tokens)
- Cross-domain evaluation
- Model and dataset cards (internal)

Templates live in docs/kb/templates/.
