# KB Cards

We maintain lightweight, reusable “cards” to capture:

- Integration principles (cross-domain guidance we adopt)
- Method families (e.g., Ensemble Integration)
- External model patterns (two-tower, JEPA/hub-tokens)
- Cross-domain evaluation
- Model and dataset cards (internal)

Templates live in docs/kb/templates/.

The actual cards (YAML) live under `kb/` at the repository root—use the templates here as a starting point, then drop the finished card into `kb/model_cards`, `kb/datasets`, `kb/paper_cards`, or `kb/integration_cards` as appropriate.
