# Oncology Multimodal Review — Principles

Key taxonomy
- Early / intermediate / late fusion (trade-offs)

Practical cautions
- Heterogeneous semantics, alignment, missingness, over-smoothing (GNNs), confounds, leakage.

Practices we adopt
- Residualization, harmonization, fold sharing, AUROC/AUPRC, significance testing.

Implications for our project
- Start with late integration; deconfound per modality; only escalate when fusion gains are established.
