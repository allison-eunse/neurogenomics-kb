# Brain Harmony

Purpose
- Unifies sMRI + fMRI; addresses heterogeneous TRs.

Key mechanisms
- TAPE (Temporal Adaptive Patch Embedding) resizes temporal tokens to fixed duration τ.
- Hub tokens to fuse modalities.

Portability
- Useful if TR/site heterogeneity limits our baselines; heavier engineering cost.
